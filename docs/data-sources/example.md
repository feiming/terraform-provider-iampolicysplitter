# iam_policy_splitter (Data Source)

Splits an IAM policy by statements and rearranges them to fit within character limits. This is useful when you have a large IAM policy that exceeds AWS limits (6,144 characters for managed policies, 2,048 characters for inline policies).

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "iampolicysplitter_iam_policy_splitter" "example" {
  policy_json = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17"
    Statement = [
      {
        Sid    = "S3BucketAccess"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "s3:GetObject",
          "s3:PutObject",
          "s3:DeleteObject"
        ]
        Resource = [
          "arn:aws:s3:::production-data-bucket/*",
          "arn:aws:s3:::staging-data-bucket/*"
        ]
      },
      {
        Sid    = "EC2InstanceManagement"
        Effect = "Allow"
        Action = [
          "ec2:DescribeInstances",
          "ec2:StartInstances",
          "ec2:StopInstances"
        ]
        Resource = "*"
      }
    ]
  })
  max_chars = 2048
}

output "split_policies" {
  value = data.iampolicysplitter_iam_policy_splitter.example.split_policies
}
```
