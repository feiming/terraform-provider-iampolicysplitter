# iampolicysplitter Provider

The IAM Policy Splitter provider helps split large IAM policies into smaller policies that fit within AWS character limits.

This provider is useful when you have a large IAM policy that exceeds AWS limits:
- **Managed policies**: Maximum 6,144 characters
- **Inline policies**: Maximum 2,048 characters

The provider uses a bin-packing algorithm to efficiently group policy statements into multiple policies that comply with AWS limits.

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iampolicysplitter" {
  # no provider-specific config
}
```
